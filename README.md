# AI in Healthcare - KULeuvenX

**1. Added value of AI in healthcare:** \
We begin by unraveling the value that AI can bring to healthcare. AI can be used in applications ranging from improving patient diagnosis to enabling groundbreaking medical discoveries. As such, we will explore how AI can impact different domains in the healthcare landscape.
- Identify the different impact domains of AI in healthcare:

DIAGNOSIS & PROGNOSIS \
*Medical diagnosis* is the process by which healthcare professionals identify and determine the nature of a patient's health condition or disease based on symptoms, medical history, physical examinations, and often, diagnostic tests or medical imaging. 

*Medical prognosis* refers to the prediction or forecast of the expected course and outcome of a patient's health condition or disease. It provides information about the likely progression, recovery, or outcome of the condition.

TREATMENT & THERAPY \
*Medical treatment* refers to the use of medical interventions, procedures, medications, or therapies by healthcare professionals to address and manage health conditions, injuries, or diseases in patients with the goal of improving their health and well-being. 

*Medical therapy* typically involves a systematic and structured approach to treat physical or mental health issues. It often includes counselling, rehabilitation, or other interventions to help individuals recover from injuries, manage chronic conditions, or address psychological and emotional well-being.


- Recognize the importance of learning the fundamentals of clinical machine learning for all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.
- Gain knowledge about the origins of machine learning in healthcare.
- Understand the context and principles of common terms and definitions in machine learning.
- Define wording in the fields of machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence.
- Start recognizing the challenges and limitations to machine learning approach in healthcare.
- Understand the first principles for designing machine learning applications for healthcare.

**2. Definition of AI:** Before delving deeper, we need to clarify: what exactly is Artificial Intelligence? We will break down AI into its fundamental components, ensuring a solid foundation for further exploration.
- **Timeline of AI:** To appreciate the context in which AI operates in healthcare, we will embark on a historical journey through the evolution of AI. We will trace its origins, key milestones, and pivotal moments that have shaped its current prominence.
- **Digital transformation in healthcare:** The integration of AI is a cornerstone of the ongoing digital transformation in healthcare. We will examine how the digital transformation of healthcare systems could contribute to achieving greater efficiency and improved patient care.
- **The good, the bad and the ugly of AI:** AI in healthcare is a double-edged sword. While it offers tremendous promise, it also raises ethical and practical concerns. We will navigate this complex terrain, discussing both the positive impacts and putting the finger on some potential hurdles for deployment of AI.
